# Spot_the_Difference_prototype

This is my project game prototype. This is basically a "Spot the Difference" game recreated in 3D spaces. You are given a scene for a fixed period of time and given the freedom to roam around the scene and memorize the structure and placement of objects. Then when the time ends, you will be given a second scene which looks alike but contains subtle differences. Spot them all and proceed to the next stage!

This is only a prototype. I'm not sure if I will go on to finish this game and make it market-ready. We'll see about that later.
